# Behavioral Design Patterns

Behavioral design patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects. These focus on how our objects interact with each other or how we interact with them.

The main approach of behavioral design patterns is encapsulating. During the situations when an aspect changes often, these patterns define an encapsulation object. Then other parts of the program can collaborate with the object whenever they depend on that aspect. The patterns usually define an abstract class that describes the encapsulating object, and the pattern derives its name from that object.
