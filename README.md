# DesignPatterns
The patterns in this repository were created based on "Gang of Four"s book named [“Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns). Gang of Four, or in short GoF, are [Erich Gamma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erich_Gamma), [Richard Helm](https://wiki.c2.com/?RichardHelm), [Ralph Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Johnson_(computer_scientist)), and [John Vlissides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Vlissides) who are the four horsemen of software engineering.
